# determination-of-optical-fibers-strength
# A project to determine the strength of optical fiber (ENGLISH V)

## Description

The project is aimed at developing a set of software and hardware tools for determining the strength characteristics of optical fiber by uniaxial stretching. The aim of the project is to create a solution that allows accurate and reproducible measurements necessary to ensure the reliability of fiber-optic cable systems.

## Why

Uniaxial tensile tests are critically important for determining the strength properties of optical fiber and its performance characteristics. The design of the device and the development of appropriate software make it possible to accurately measure these parameters, significantly increasing the reliability of the final fiber-optic products.

## Project parts

* **Calculation part**: Determination of the destruction force of the fiber and the output of mathematical expressions.
* **Device prototype**: Development and creation of a device for measuring the breaking strength of optical fibers.
* **Software**:         Software development with adaptive web design for managing the measurement and data analysis process.

## Technology stack

* Server software for data processing and storage
* Client interface for measurement and data analysis
* Using Young's modulus for strength calculations
